I am a PhD student at the Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation at the University of Amsterdam. I work on data-efficient machine translation through the induction of latent structure in translation data. In my work I criticise neural machine translation systems from a probabilistic perspective and aim to improve such models by doing better probabilistic modelling. My research is part of the European [GoURMET](http://gourmet-project.eu/) project. My thesis adviser is [dr. Wilker Ferreira Aziz](http://wilkeraziz.github.io/).

You can find my CV [here](/assets/files/CV.pdf).

### News
* We released a pre-print of our new work investigating the appropriateness of MAP decoding in NMT. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.10283)
* Auto-Encoding Variational Neural Machine Translation was accepted as a long paper at RepL4NLP.
* We developed a [notebook](https://github.com/probabll/dgm4nlp/blob/solutions/notebooks/sentencevae/SentVAE_Solutions.ipynb) describing and implementing a sentence VAE ([Bowman et. al, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06349)) in PyTorch.
* The European [GoURMET](http://gourmet-project.eu/) project, and with that my PhD, started!
