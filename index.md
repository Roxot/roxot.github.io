I am a PhD student at the Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation at the University of Amsterdam. I work on data-efficient machine translation through the induction of latent structure in translation data. In my work I criticise neural machine translation systems from a probabilistic perspective and aim to improve such models by doing better probabilistic modelling. My research is part of the European [GoURMET](http://gourmet-project.eu/) project. My thesis adviser is [dr. Wilker Ferreira Aziz](http://wilkeraziz.github.io/).

You can find my CV [here](/assets/files/CV.pdf).
